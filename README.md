# philosophers42
In this project, from school 42, one has to learn the basics of threading a process and creating threads. We also discover the mutex.

1) Malloc table->philosophes (t_philosophe * nb_philosophe)
2) Malloc table->forks  (mutex * nb fokrs)

3) init struct table->philo
4) init mutex : printer et forks
